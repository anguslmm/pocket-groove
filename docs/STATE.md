# Work state (2026-11-11)

v0.1 complete and host-verified: 45/45 host tests pass; both firmware envs build clean.
Nothing has run on real hardware yet. Waiting on the user for: smoke-test report
(build/firmware/pocket-groove-smoke.bin), first boot of the instrument
(build/firmware/pocket-groove.bin), and listening feedback on renders.

Stem bounce + USB project transfer (tools/pg, docs/MANUAL.md chapter 15): host-verified
(itest_bounce, itest_golden, test_io_xfer, test_pg_client: the Python client against the
device protocol code on a pty); the firmware side (src/app glue, real USB-Serial/JTAG timing,
DTR/RTS not resetting the board, LittleFS/FAT behaviour) has not run on hardware.

USB audio (stereo input over USB, UAC1 + CDC): feasible with the prebuilt TinyUSB; spike
env:usb-audio-spike (src/usbspike, build/firmware/pocket-groove-usbspike.bin) built and
checked offline only, waiting for the hardware test in docs/usb-audio.md section 8.

Known follow-ups:
- pg::io: FAT (SD) save-replace has a power-cut window inside FatFs rename; make it safe.
- Per-pattern sound settings and a second p-lock per step (data-model change, v0.2).
- Autosave while playing, if the measured flash stall allows it.
- Performance recording: log the timestamped Commands the UI posts and replay them through
  host/common/bounce.h (Pass timeline), so live moves end up in bounces.
- CPU: reciprocal for the bass divide, reverb tank, shared hat bank (if hardware load is high).
- UX.md / mockup key maps lag the implementation in a few places (see MANUAL.md, which is accurate).
Rule from the user: subagents run on Opus (Sonnet for trivial tasks), never Fable.
